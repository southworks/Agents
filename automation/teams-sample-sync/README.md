# Teams sample synchronization

This workflow synchronizes selected Teams SDK .NET samples into their existing Agents SDK
counterparts. It has three GitHub Actions jobs: plan, migrate, and publish. Migration has Copilot
access but no repository-write credential. Publishing has repository-write access but never starts
Copilot or executes the candidate.

For each changed sample, one persistent Copilot implementation session first creates a Markdown
migration plan without write permission. The coordinator saves and hashes that plan. The same
session then uses the Teams-to-Agents and manifest skills to implement it, validate its work, and
self-audit the final files against the frozen plan. The workflow independently runs the full
validator, allows one repair turn for deterministic failures, and publishes only a verified patch.

Copilot uses Auto routing. The workflow records the observed model for diagnosis but does not
select a model, enumerate a model catalog, or force a reasoning effort.

The workflow preserves pinned source commits, source context, selected-sample write confinement,
full validation, incremental state, and patch verification. It does not use a reviewer session,
agent-authored evidence schemas, report-only PRs, or policy configuration.

Run locally from the repository root:

```sh
npm ci --prefix automation/teams-sample-sync
npm test --prefix automation/teams-sample-sync
npm run build --prefix automation/teams-sample-sync
dotnet test automation/teams-sample-sync/tests/contracts/TeamsSampleSync.ContractTests.csproj
```

The live Copilot smoke test is opt-in because it consumes usage. Set
`TEAMS_SYNC_SDK_SMOKE=1` before running `npm run test:sdk-smoke --prefix automation/teams-sample-sync`.
