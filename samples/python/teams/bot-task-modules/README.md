# Task Modules Agent - Python

This sample demonstrates three Microsoft Teams task-module interactions using the
Microsoft 365 Agents SDK: an Adaptive Card form, a hosted custom form, and a
two-step Adaptive Card form. The forms are opened from card buttons, not slash
commands.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11.14
- An Azure Bot registration with its client ID, secret, and tenant ID
- The Teams app manifest in `manifest/`
- A public Dev Tunnel when testing Teams dialogs, because Teams must reach the
  custom form URL

## Windows PowerShell setup

From this sample directory, install dependencies and prepare `.env`:

```powershell
..\sample.ps1 setup
```

Configure the connection values in `.env`, then start the sample:

```powershell
..\sample.ps1 run
```

No activation or session variables are needed. Setup checks Python 3.11.14,
installs dependencies, checks imports, and preserves an existing `.env`.
Each sample uses `.venv` inside its own directory. Setup reuses an existing
environment and rejects an interpreter-version mismatch.

If Python 3.11.14 is not discovered automatically, select its Windows executable:

```powershell
..\sample.ps1 setup -PythonPath "C:\path\to\python.exe"
```

To keep environments outside the samples, pass `-EnvironmentRoot "C:\venvs"`
to both commands; each sample then gets its own named environment there.
The launcher installs `requirements.txt` on Windows. The checked-in hash lock
is for Linux; reproducible Windows deployment requires a Windows-specific lock.

Windows long-path support is required by the Graph SDK. If setup reports that
it is disabled, run this once in administrator PowerShell, then restart Windows:

```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" -Name LongPathsEnabled -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force
```

## Run locally

1. From this directory, create and activate a fresh virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the platform-specific, hash-locked dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock
   ```

   The lock is generated for CPython 3.11.14 on Linux x86_64. Resolve and validate
   a new lock on another platform rather than assuming wheel hashes are portable.

3. Copy `.env.TEMPLATE` to `.env` and set the Azure Bot connection values.
   `BOT_ENDPOINT` must be the public HTTPS Dev Tunnel base URL when testing the
   custom form in Teams. Set `BOT_DOMAIN` to the hostname from `BOT_ENDPOINT`,
   without the scheme or path; this value replaces `${{BOT_DOMAIN}}` in the
   manifest's `validDomains` before packaging.

4. Start the agent:

   ```bash
   python -m src.main
   ```

The host listens on port `3978` by default. `GET /` is a readiness endpoint;
authenticated activity requests are processed at `POST /api/messages`.

## Dialogs

- **Adaptive Card** collects multiline text and returns a submission acknowledgement.
- **Custom Form** serves `/customform` and collects a name and email address.
- **Multi-step Form** collects a name, carries it into the email step, then sends
  a personalized completion message.

Provision the Azure Bot messaging endpoint as
`https://<your-devtunnel-domain>/api/messages`. The sample manifest uses local
sample identity placeholders; replace them and the dialog domain with the
values for your app before packaging or distribution.
