# Teams AI messages agent (Python)

This sample demonstrates AI-generated labels, sensitivity metadata, citations, and
custom feedback in Microsoft Teams agent messages.

## Prerequisites

- CPython 3.11.14 on Linux x86_64 (the `requirements.lock` was resolved and
  validated for this runtime and platform)
- An Azure Bot registration with its application ID, tenant ID, and client secret
- A Teams development environment and an HTTPS tunnel for local testing

## Windows PowerShell setup

From this sample directory, install dependencies and prepare `.env`:

```powershell
..\sample.ps1 setup
```

Configure the connection values in `.env`, then start the sample:

```powershell
..\sample.ps1 run
```

No activation or session variables are needed. Setup checks Python 3.11.14,
installs dependencies, checks imports, and preserves an existing `.env`.
Each sample uses `.venv` inside its own directory. Setup reuses an existing
environment and rejects an interpreter-version mismatch.

If Python 3.11.14 is not discovered automatically, select its Windows executable:

```powershell
..\sample.ps1 setup -PythonPath "C:\path\to\python.exe"
```

To keep environments outside the samples, pass `-EnvironmentRoot "C:\venvs"`
to both commands; each sample then gets its own named environment there.
The launcher installs `requirements.txt` on Windows. The checked-in hash lock
is for Linux; reproducible Windows deployment requires a Windows-specific lock.

Windows long-path support is required by the Graph SDK. If setup reports that
it is disabled, run this once in administrator PowerShell, then restart Windows:

```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" -Name LongPathsEnabled -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force
```

## Configure and run

From this directory, create and activate a fresh virtual environment, then install
the platform-specific, hash-locked dependencies:

```sh
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock
cp .env.TEMPLATE .env
```

The wheel lock is specific to Linux x86_64 with CPython 3.11.14; it is not a
universal lock for other runtimes or platforms. For another runtime or platform,
resolve dependencies through a trusted process and validate the resulting lock
there before installing it.

Set `CONNECTIONS__SERVICE_CONNECTION__SETTINGS__CLIENTID`,
`CONNECTIONS__SERVICE_CONNECTION__SETTINGS__CLIENTSECRET`, and
`CONNECTIONS__SERVICE_CONNECTION__SETTINGS__TENANTID` in `.env` to the Azure Bot
credentials. Never commit `.env` or its secrets.

Expose port 3978 using an HTTPS development tunnel and set the Azure Bot messaging
endpoint to `https://YOUR_HOST/api/messages`. Start the agent with:

```sh
python -m src.main
```

The root URL is a credential-free readiness check; Teams message requests remain
protected by the Agents SDK authentication middleware. Package `manifest/manifest.json`
with `manifest/color.png` and `manifest/outline.png` at the package root before
uploading the app to Teams. Replace the sample app ID placeholder before packaging.

## Try the agent

Send a message containing `label`, `sensitivity`, `feedback`, or `citation` to see
the corresponding message metadata. If a message contains multiple keywords, the
first matching feature in that order is used: label, sensitivity, feedback, citation.
These are ordinary message keywords, not slash or mention commands; the manifest
therefore has no `bots[].commandLists` entries. The feedback card accepts a reaction
and optional text. Other messages receive help listing these keywords.

`src.agent.create_agent()` exposes an importable application factory, and importing
it does not start a server or contact Teams. Local protected checks inject offline
connection and adapter dependencies while dispatching through the Agents SDK.
