# Quick Start

This is a sample of a simple Agent that is hosted on an Node.js web service.  This Agent is configured to accept a request and echo the text of the request back to the caller.

This Agent Sample is intended to introduce you to the basic operation of the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK messaging loop. It can also be used as the base for a custom Agent you choose to develop.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 20 or higher

    ```bash
    # determine node version
    node --version
    ```


## Running this sample

1. Open this folder from your IDE or Terminal of preference
1. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Run in localhost, anonymous mode

1. Start the application

```sh
npm run build
npm run start:anon
```

At this point you should see the message 

```text
Server listening to port 3978 for appId  debug undefined
```

The agent is ready to accept messages.

### Interact with the bot from the Teams App Test Tool

To interact with the bot you need a chat client, during the install phase we have acquired the `teams-test-app-tool` than can be used to interact with your bot running in `localhost:3978`

> [!Important]
> The test tool only supports anonymous mode, that means without any `clientId`.

1. Start the test tool with 

```bash
npm run test-tool
```

The tool will open a web browser showing the Teams App Test Tool, ready to send messages to your bot.

Alternatively you can run the next command to start the bot and the test tool with a single command (make sure you stop the bot started previously):

```bash
npm test
```

Refresh the browser to start a new conversation with the Echo bot.

You should see a message from the bot like: `Echo running on Agents SDK version: {version}`


### Interact with the agent with WebChat UI using Azure Bot Service

1. [Create an Azure Bot](https://aka.ms/AgentsSDK-CreateBot)
   - Record the Application ID, the Tenant ID, and the Client Secret for use below
  
1. Configuring the token connection in the Agent settings
    1. Open the `env.TEMPLATE` file in the root of the sample project, rename it to `.env` and configure the following values:
      1. Set the **connections__serviceConnection__settings__clientId** to the AppId of the bot identity.
      2. Set the **connections__serviceConnection__settings__clientSecret** to the Secret that was created for your identity. *This is the `Secret Value` shown in the AppRegistration*.
      3. Set the **connections__serviceConnection__settings__tenantId** to the Tenant Id where your application is registered.

1. Install the tool [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows)   
1. Run `dev tunnels`. See [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

1. Take note of the url shown after `Connect via browser:`

4. On the Azure Bot, select **Settings**, then **Configuration**, and update the **Messaging endpoint** to `{tunnel-url}/api/messages`

5. Start the Agent using `npm start`

6. Select **Test in WebChat** on the Azure portal.


### Deploy to Azure

[TBD]
