# Proactive Sample

This is a sample of a simple Agent that is hosted on an Asp.net core web service.  This sample demonstrates the basics of a proactive conversation using in-code and Http triggers.

## Prerequisites

- [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) version 8.0
- [dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows)

## QuickStart using WebChat

- Overview of running and testing an Agent
  - Provision an Azure Bot in your Azure Subscription
  - Configure your Agent settings to use to desired authentication type
  - Running an instance of the Agent app (either locally or deployed to Azure)
  - Test in a client

1. Create an Azure Bot with one of these authentication types
   - [SingleTenant, Client Secret](https://github.com/microsoft/Agents/blob/main/docs/HowTo/azurebot-create-single-secret.md)
   - [SingleTenant, Federated Credentials](https://github.com/microsoft/Agents/blob/main/docs/HowTo/azurebot-create-fic.md) 
   - [User Assigned Managed Identity](https://github.com/microsoft/Agents/blob/main/docs/HowTo/azurebot-create-msi.md)

1. Configuring the authentication connection in the Agent settings
   > These instructions are for **SingleTenant, Client Secret**. For other auth type configuration, see [DotNet MSAL Authentication](https://github.com/microsoft/Agents/blob/main/docs/HowTo/MSALAuthConfigurationOptions.md).
   1. Open the `appsettings.json` file in the root of the sample project.

   1. Find the section labeled `Connections`,  it should appear similar to this:

      ```json
      "Connections": {
        "ServiceConnection": {
          "Settings": {
            "AuthType": "ClientSecret", // this is the AuthType for the connection, valid values can be found in Microsoft.Agents.Authentication.Msal.Model.AuthTypes.  The default is ClientSecret.
            "AuthorityEndpoint": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{{TenantId}}",
            "ClientId": "{{ClientId}}", // this is the Client ID used for the connection.
            "ClientSecret": "{{ClientSecret}}", // this is the Client Secret used for the connection.
            "Scopes": [
              "https://api.botframework.com/.default"
            ]
          }
        }
      },
      ```

      1. Replace all **{{ClientId}}** with the AppId of the Azure Bot.
      1. Replace all **{{TenantId}}** with the Tenant Id where your application is registered.
      1. Set the **{{ClientSecret}}** to the Secret that was created on the App Registration.
      
      > Storing sensitive values in appsettings is not recommend.  Follow [AspNet Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-9.0) for best practices.

1. Running the Agent
   1. Running the Agent locally
      - Requires a tunneling tool to allow for local development and debugging should you wish to do local development whilst connected to a external client such as Microsoft Teams.
      - **For ClientSecret or Certificate authentication types only.**  Federated Credentials and Managed Identity will not work via a tunnel to a local agent and must be deployed to an App Service or container.
      
      1. Run `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:

         ```bash
         devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
         ```

      1. On the Azure Bot, select **Settings**, then **Configuration**, and update the **Messaging endpoint** to `{tunnel-url}/api/messages`

      1. Start the Agent in Visual Studio

   1. Deploy Agent code to Azure
      1. VS Publish works well for this.  But any tools used to deploy a web application will also work.
      1. On the Azure Bot, select **Settings**, then **Configuration**, and update the **Messaging endpoint** to `https://{{appServiceDomain}}/api/messages`

## Testing this agent with WebChat

   1. Select **Test in WebChat** on the Azure Bot
   2. Send and message proactively via an Http request
      1. Send "-s"
      1. Copy the returned conversation Id
      1. POST to `http://localhost:3978/proactive/sendActivity/{conversationId}` with a body of
         ```json
         {
           "type": "message",
           "text": "Your job finished successfully."
         }
         ```
      1. That message will be displayed in the chat
   3. Send a proactive message from code
      1. Send `-c {conversationId}`  
      1. The chat will show the message "This is OnContinueConversation"
         1. This was send by the code in `ProactiveAgent`.  You can perform anything you would normaly do for that conversation in the handler.
   4. Continue a conversation using Http and the Conversation data (not a stored conversation)
      1. Send "-convo"
      1. Copy the json sent to the chat
      1. POST to `http://localhost:3978/proactive/continue` with a body of that JSON.  For example (something similar to this):
         ```json
         {
            "reference": {
              "activityId":"CCjfufUIRyLKQnP2VVlIBU-us|0000001",
              "user": {
                "id":"user-id"
              },
              "bot": {
                "id": "bot-id",
                "name": "bot-name"
              },
              "conversation": {
                "id":"conversation-id"
              },
              "channelId":"webchat",
              "serviceUrl":"​https://webchat.botframework.com/",
              "locale":"en-US",
              "requestId":"0HNL639LRRSPR:00000003"
            },
            "claims": {
              "iss": "https://api.botframework.com",
              "aud":"your-agent-clientid"
            }
         }
         ```
      1. You will see the message "This is OnContinueConversation" in the chat.  This is the same code that #3 above hit.

## Enabling JWT token validation
1. By default, the AspNet token validation is disabled in order to support local debugging.
1. Enable by updating appsettings
   ```json
   "TokenValidation": {
     "Enabled": false,
     "Audiences": [
       "{{ClientId}}" // this is the Client ID used for the Azure Bot
     ],
     "TenantId": "{{TenantId}}"
   },
   ```
