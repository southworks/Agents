# Agentic Users and Terms
To create an AI Teammate who works alongside humans, Microsoft introduced few key concepts like Agent Blueprint (AB), Agent Identity (AI), Agentic User (AU). Agentic Users are autonomous agents that want to behave like user accounts.

**Agentic User** is an identity for an autonomous agent that acts like a user to access resources. Each agentic user is tied to a particular agent instance "parent", and from there to a specific Agent ID Blueprint. Agentic users support the features of normal user accounts -- they can have mailboxes and participate in chats, etc., with some small restrictions for security.

**Agent ID Blueprint** is an application that holds the business logic and orchestration for an agent and has the ability to create and manage agent identities. These agent identities are tied to their parent Agent ID Blueprint and can only be managed by that specific Blueprint. 

[TODO - Confirm] This value will match the Agent ID configured in the Azure Bot Service.

**Agent Identity** is an app-like identity, derived from service principal that represents an autonomous agent. An Agent ID Blueprint can get tokens for its child Agent Identities through FIC impersonation. Agent Identities are single tenant, created in the tenant where the Agent ID Blueprint is installed, but a given Agent ID Blueprint can create and manage multiple Agent Identities within a single tenant.

**Agentic Instance ID**

**Agentic Instance Token**

## Authentication Errors (-60000 to -60999)

### -60012
Failed to Acquire Token

Failed to acquire token. {error_details}

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when the MSAL authentication component fails to obtain an access token from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD). This typically happens during the token acquisition process in the `MsalAuth.get_access_token()` or `acquire_token_on_behalf_of()` methods. The error may be triggered by invalid credentials, expired client secrets, misconfigured authentication settings, network issues, or insufficient permissions. The authentication response payload is included in the error message to help diagnose the specific cause.

**Likely Fix:**
Verify your authentication configuration including client ID, client secret or certificate, and tenant ID. Ensure the client secret hasn't expired in your Azure app registration. Check that the requested scopes are properly configured and the app has the necessary API permissions. Review the error payload in the exception message for specific details from Microsoft Entra ID. For managed identity scenarios, confirm the identity is properly assigned to the resource.

---

### -60013
Invalid Instance URL

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when the SDK attempts to validate a resource URL and determines it is malformed or invalid. This occurs in the `MsalAuth.get_access_token()` method before attempting token acquisition. The URL validation ensures that the resource endpoint is properly formatted and can be used for authentication requests.

**Likely Fix:**
Review the resource URL being passed to the authentication method. Ensure it follows proper URL formatting standards (e.g., `https://graph.microsoft.com`). Check for typos, missing protocols (http/https), or malformed domain names. Verify that the URL matches the expected format for the service you're trying to authenticate against.

---

### -60014
On-Behalf-Of Flow Not Supported with Managed Identity

On-behalf-of flow is not supported with Managed Identity authentication.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when code attempts to use the on-behalf-of (OBO) authentication flow with a Managed Identity authentication client. The OBO flow allows an application to exchange a user's token for a token to call downstream APIs, but this pattern is not compatible with Managed Identity authentication, which uses system or user-assigned identities without user context. This is detected in the `acquire_token_on_behalf_of()` method when the MSAL client is an instance of `ManagedIdentityClient`.

**Likely Fix:**
Review your authentication architecture. If you need OBO flow for user-delegated permissions, use Confidential Client Application authentication with a client secret or certificate instead of Managed Identity. If using Managed Identity is required for your scenario, restructure your authentication flow to use service-to-service authentication without OBO, or implement a different pattern for downstream API calls.

---

### -60015
On-Behalf-Of Flow Not Supported with Current Auth Type

On-behalf-of flow is not supported with the current authentication type: {auth_type}

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when the on-behalf-of flow is attempted with an authentication client type that doesn't support it. Currently, the SDK only supports OBO flow with `ConfidentialClientApplication`. If the authentication client is of an unsupported type, this error will be thrown. This validation occurs in the `acquire_token_on_behalf_of()` method after checking for Managed Identity.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure you're using Confidential Client Application authentication (with client secret or certificate) when implementing on-behalf-of flows. Verify your authentication configuration is set to `AuthTypes.ClientSecret` or `AuthTypes.ClientCertificate`. Review your `AgentAuthConfiguration` to confirm the authentication type matches your intended flow.

---

### -60016
Authentication Type Not Supported

**Description & Context:**
This error indicates that an unsupported or unrecognized authentication type was specified in the configuration. The SDK supports specific authentication types including client secret, client certificate, managed identity (system and user-assigned), and federated credentials. When an authentication type outside these supported options is provided, this error is raised.

**Likely Fix:**
Review your `AgentAuthConfiguration` and ensure the `AUTH_TYPE` is set to one of the supported values: `AuthTypes.ClientSecret`, `AuthTypes.ClientCertificate`, `AuthTypes.ManagedIdentitySystem`, `AuthTypes.ManagedIdentityUser`, or other officially supported types. Check the SDK documentation for the current list of supported authentication types and update your configuration accordingly.

---

### -60017
Agent Application Instance ID Required

Agent application instance Id must be provided.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when attempting to acquire an agentic application token without providing the required agent application instance ID. The instance ID is essential for identifying the specific agent instance in agentic authentication scenarios, where the SDK needs to obtain tokens for agent-to-agent or agent-to-service communication within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure you pass a valid agent application instance ID when calling methods that require agentic authentication. The instance ID should be obtained from your agent registration in the Microsoft 365 platform. Verify that your agent configuration includes this ID and that it's being correctly passed to the authentication methods like `get_agentic_application_token()` or `get_agentic_instance_token()`.

---

### -60018
Failed to Acquire Agentic Instance Token

Failed to acquire agentic instance token or agent token for agent_app_instance_id {instance_id}

**Description & Context:**
This error is thrown when the SDK fails to obtain an agentic instance token during the multi-step agentic authentication flow. This typically occurs in the `get_agentic_instance_token()` method after attempting to acquire both an agent token and an instance token. The failure may be due to invalid agent instance credentials, misconfigured agent registration, or issues with the token exchange process specific to the agentic identity model.

**Likely Fix:**
Verify that the agent application instance ID is correctly registered in your Microsoft 365 environment. Ensure the agent has the necessary permissions and that the agent token acquisition was successful. Check that your tenant ID and agent application configuration are correct. Review the authentication logs for more specific error details from the token acquisition attempt.

---

### -60019
Agent Application Instance ID and User ID Required

Agent application instance Id and agentic user Id must be provided.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when attempting to acquire an agentic user token but one or both of the required identifiers (agent application instance ID and agentic user ID) are missing. Agentic user tokens are used when an agent needs to act on behalf of a specific user within the agentic framework, requiring both the agent's identity and the user's identity to be specified.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure both the agent application instance ID and the agentic user ID are provided when calling `get_agentic_user_token()`. Verify that these identifiers are correctly obtained from your agent and user context. Check that your application properly tracks and passes both IDs through the authentication flow.

---

### -60020
Failed to Acquire Instance or Agent Token

Failed to acquire instance token or agent token for agent_app_instance_id {instance_id} and agentic_user_id {user_id}

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when the SDK fails to obtain either the instance token or agent token during the agentic user token acquisition process. This is a prerequisite failure in `get_agentic_user_token()` where the method first calls `get_agentic_instance_token()` and fails to receive valid tokens. Without these tokens, the SDK cannot proceed to acquire a user token in the agentic context.

**Likely Fix:**
Follow the troubleshooting steps for error -60018 first, as this error indicates a failure in the underlying instance token acquisition. Verify that both the agent application instance ID and agentic user ID are valid and correctly formatted. Ensure the agent instance is properly configured and has the necessary permissions to acquire tokens for user delegation.

---

## Storage - Cosmos DB Errors (-61000 to -61999)

### -61000
Cosmos DB Config Required

CosmosDBStorage: CosmosDBConfig is required.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when attempting to validate or create a CosmosDB storage instance without providing a valid `CosmosDBStorageConfig` object. The validation is performed by the `CosmosDBStorageConfig.validate_cosmos_db_config()` static method, which checks if the config object itself is None or missing. This is the first validation step before checking individual configuration properties.

**Likely Fix:**
Create a valid `CosmosDBStorageConfig` object with the required parameters before initializing CosmosDB storage. Ensure you're passing the config object to the storage initialization method and that it's not None. Example: `config = CosmosDBStorageConfig(cosmos_db_endpoint="...", auth_key="...", database_id="...", container_id="...")`.

---

### -61001
Cosmos DB Endpoint Required

CosmosDBStorage: cosmos_db_endpoint is required.

**Description & Context:**
This error is thrown during configuration validation when the `cosmos_db_endpoint` property is missing or empty. The endpoint is the URL to your Cosmos DB account and is essential for establishing a connection. This validation occurs in the `validate_cosmos_db_config()` method after confirming the config object exists.

**Likely Fix:**
Provide a valid Cosmos DB endpoint URL in your configuration. The endpoint should be in the format `https://<your-account-name>.documents.azure.com:443/`. You can find this endpoint in the Azure Portal under your Cosmos DB account's "Keys" section. Set it in your `CosmosDBStorageConfig` constructor or configuration file.

---

### -61002
Cosmos DB Auth Key Required

CosmosDBStorage: auth_key is required.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when the authentication key (primary or secondary key) for Cosmos DB is not provided in the configuration. The auth key is required for authenticating requests to Cosmos DB when not using alternative authentication methods like managed identity or token credentials. This is validated as part of the configuration validation process.

**Likely Fix:**
Provide the Cosmos DB account key in your configuration. You can find the primary and secondary keys in the Azure Portal under your Cosmos DB account's "Keys" section. Set the `auth_key` parameter in your `CosmosDBStorageConfig`. If using managed identity or token credentials, ensure you're using the `credential` parameter instead and that your configuration properly reflects this authentication method.

---

### -61003
Cosmos DB Database ID Required

CosmosDBStorage: database_id is required.

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when the database identifier is missing from the Cosmos DB configuration. The database ID specifies which database within your Cosmos DB account to use for storage operations. Without this, the SDK cannot determine where to read or write data. This validation is performed during config validation.

**Likely Fix:**
Specify the database ID in your `CosmosDBStorageConfig`. The database should already exist in your Cosmos DB account, or you need to create it. Set the `database_id` parameter to match the name of your database (e.g., "bot-database"). Verify the database exists in your Cosmos DB account through the Azure Portal or Data Explorer.

---

### -61004
Cosmos DB Container ID Required

CosmosDBStorage: container_id is required.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when the container (collection) identifier is not provided in the configuration. The container ID specifies which container within the database to use for storing bot state and conversation data. This is the final required configuration parameter validated before the storage instance can be created.

**Likely Fix:**
Provide a valid container ID in your `CosmosDBStorageConfig` by setting the `container_id` parameter (e.g., "bot-storage"). Ensure the container exists in your specified database, or configure the SDK to create it automatically using the `container_throughput` parameter. You can verify container existence through the Azure Portal's Data Explorer.

---

### -61005
Cosmos DB Key Cannot Be Empty

CosmosDBStorage: Key cannot be empty.

**Description & Context:**
This error is thrown when attempting to perform a storage operation with an empty or null key. In Cosmos DB storage operations, the key is used to uniquely identify documents/items. An empty key would make it impossible to store or retrieve specific conversation state or user data, leading to data integrity issues.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure that storage keys are properly generated and are never empty or null before storage operations. Check your state management code to verify that conversation IDs, user IDs, or other identifiers used as storage keys are properly initialized and not empty strings. Review the code path leading to the storage operation to ensure proper key generation.

---

### -61006
Cosmos DB Partition Key Invalid

CosmosDBStorage: PartitionKey of {provided_key} cannot be used with a CosmosDbPartitionedStorageOptions.PartitionKey of {expected_key}.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when there's a mismatch between the partition key specified in a storage item and the partition key configured in the storage options. Cosmos DB uses partition keys for data distribution and performance optimization. When partitioned storage is enabled, all items must use consistent partition key values that match the configuration.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure your partition key configuration is consistent between your `CosmosDbPartitionedStorageOptions` and the actual data being stored. Verify that custom state implementations correctly set the partition key property to match the configured value. Review your partitioning strategy and ensure it's properly implemented across all state objects.

---

### -61007
Cosmos DB Partition Key Path Invalid

CosmosDBStorage: PartitionKeyPath must match cosmosDbPartitionedStorageOptions value of {expected_path}

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when the partition key path defined in the Cosmos DB container doesn't match the partition key path specified in the storage options. The partition key path defines which property in your documents is used for partitioning. A mismatch between the container's partition key path and your configuration will cause storage operations to fail.

**Likely Fix:**
Verify that your container's partition key path (configured when creating the container) matches the `partition_key_path` in your storage configuration. You can check the container's partition key path in the Azure Portal. Either update your configuration to match the container, or create a new container with the correct partition key path. Note that partition key paths cannot be changed after container creation.

---

### -61008
Cosmos DB Compatibility Mode Required

CosmosDBStorage: compatibilityMode cannot be set when using partitionKey options.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when trying to use both compatibility mode and partition key options simultaneously. Compatibility mode is designed for backward compatibility with older versions that had a maximum key length of 255 characters, while partitioned storage uses a different architecture. These two modes are mutually exclusive and cannot be used together.

**Likely Fix:**
Choose either compatibility mode or partitioned storage, but not both. If you need partitioned storage for better performance and scalability, remove the `compatibility_mode=True` setting. If you need compatibility mode for working with existing data from older SDK versions, remove the partition key configuration. For new deployments, partitioned storage is recommended.

---

### -61009
Cosmos DB Partition Key Not Found

CosmosDBStorage: Partition key '{key}' missing from state, you may be missing custom state implementation.

**Description & Context:**
This error is thrown when a required partition key property is missing from a state object during storage operations. When using partitioned storage, every state object must include the configured partition key property. This error often occurs with custom state implementations that don't properly inherit or implement the required partition key property.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure your custom state classes include the partition key property that matches your storage configuration. If using the built-in state classes, verify they're being properly initialized with all required properties. Review your state factory methods to ensure partition keys are set before storage operations. Check the state serialization/deserialization logic to confirm the partition key is preserved.

---

### -61010
Cosmos DB Invalid Partition Key Value

CosmosDBStorage: Invalid PartitionKey property on item with id {item_id}

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when a state item has an invalid or improperly formatted partition key value. The partition key value must meet Cosmos DB's requirements and match the expected type and format. Invalid values can prevent proper data distribution and retrieval in Cosmos DB.

**Likely Fix:**
Validate the partition key values being set on your state objects. Ensure they're non-null, properly formatted, and meet any length or character restrictions. Review the code that generates or sets partition key values to ensure consistency. Check that the partition key property type matches the container's partition key definition.

---

### -61011
Invalid Key Suffix Characters

Cannot use invalid Row Key characters: {invalid_chars} in keySuffix.

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when the configured `key_suffix` contains characters that are invalid for Cosmos DB keys. Cosmos DB has restrictions on certain special characters in document IDs, including backslash (\), question mark (?), forward slash (/), hash (#), and asterisk (*). The key suffix is appended to storage keys, so it must not contain these forbidden characters.

**Likely Fix:**
Review your `key_suffix` configuration and remove any invalid characters. Use only alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and other allowed characters. If you need to encode special information in the suffix, consider using URL encoding or base64 encoding to avoid forbidden characters.

---

### -61012
Invalid Configuration

Invalid configuration: {details}

**Description & Context:**
This is a general configuration error for Cosmos DB storage that covers various misconfiguration scenarios not captured by more specific errors. It may be raised when there are logical inconsistencies in the configuration, such as providing a custom URL without credentials, or other validation failures that don't fit the specific error categories.

**Likely Fix:**
Review the error details provided in the exception message for specific guidance. Check all configuration parameters for consistency and completeness. Verify that authentication methods (auth key vs. credential) are properly configured. If using a custom service URL, ensure credentials are provided. Review the SDK documentation for current configuration requirements.

---

## Storage - Blob Errors (-61100 to -61199)

### -61100
Blob Storage Config Required

BlobStorage: BlobStorageConfig is required.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when attempting to initialize or use Blob storage without providing a valid `BlobStorageConfig` object. The configuration object is essential for establishing a connection to Azure Blob Storage and defining which container to use for storing bot state and conversation data.

**Likely Fix:**
Create and provide a valid `BlobStorageConfig` object when initializing blob storage. Ensure the config object is not None and includes all required parameters. Example: `config = BlobStorageConfig(connection_string="...", container_name="...")` or using container URL with appropriate authentication.

---

### -61101
Blob Connection String or URL Required

BlobStorage: either connection_string or container_url is required.

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when neither a connection string nor a container URL is provided in the blob storage configuration. Azure Blob Storage requires one of these authentication mechanisms to establish a connection. The connection string contains account name and key, while container URL can be used with other authentication methods like managed identity or SAS tokens.

**Likely Fix:**
Provide either a `connection_string` or a `container_url` in your `BlobStorageConfig`. The connection string can be found in the Azure Portal under your storage account's "Access keys" section. Alternatively, provide a container URL with appropriate authentication (managed identity, SAS token, or Azure AD credentials). Choose the method that best fits your security and deployment model.

---

### -61102
Blob Container Name Required

BlobStorage: container_name is required.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when the blob container name is not specified in the configuration. The container name identifies which container within the storage account should be used for storing bot data. Without a container name, the SDK cannot determine where to read or write state information.

**Likely Fix:**
Specify a valid container name in your `BlobStorageConfig` by setting the `container_name` parameter. Container names must be lowercase, 3-63 characters long, and can contain letters, numbers, and hyphens. Ensure the container exists in your storage account or configure the SDK to create it automatically. Example: `container_name="bot-state"`.

---

### -61103
Invalid Configuration

Invalid configuration: {details}

**Description & Context:**
This is a general configuration error for Blob storage covering various misconfiguration scenarios. It may be raised when there are logical issues with the provided configuration that don't fit more specific error categories, such as conflicting authentication methods or invalid parameter combinations.

**Likely Fix:**

Check that the team ID is being correctly extracted from the conversation or activity.

---

### -62006
Teams Turn Context Required

TurnContext cannot be None

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when a Teams operation requiring a turn context is called with a None value. The turn context represents the current conversational turn and contains essential information about the activity, conversation, and provides methods for sending responses. It's fundamental to bot operations.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure you're always passing a valid TurnContext object to Teams operations. Turn contexts are typically provided as parameters to bot handlers and should be passed through to any operations that need them. Check for None values before calling operations. Verify your bot handler structure is correctly receiving and passing the turn context.

---

### -62007
Teams Activity Required

Activity cannot be None

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when a Teams operation requires an activity object but receives None. Activities represent messages, events, or actions in the Bot Framework and contain crucial information about the communication. Many Teams operations need to examine or process activity data.

**Likely Fix:**

Check that you're extracting the conversation ID from the correct property. Verify the conversation ID is not None or empty before calling operations that require it.

---

## Hosting Errors (-63000 to -63999)

### -63000
Adapter Required

start_agent_process: adapter can't be None

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs in the `start_agent_process` function when no adapter is provided. The adapter is a critical component that handles communication between the bot/agent and the channel service (like Teams, Slack, or web chat). It processes incoming activities, manages authentication, and handles response delivery. This validation happens at the entry point of agent processing in both aiohttp and FastAPI hosting implementations, preventing the process from starting without this essential component.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure you create and pass a valid `CloudAdapter` instance when calling `start_agent_process`. The adapter should be initialized with proper authentication configuration via a connection manager. Example: `adapter = CloudAdapter(connection_manager=CONNECTION_MANAGER)`.

---

### -63001
Agent Application Required

start_agent_process: agent_application can't be None

**Description & Context:**
This error is thrown when the `start_agent_process` function is called without providing an agent application instance. The `AgentApplication` contains your bot's logic, message handlers, authentication configuration, and state management. Without it, there's no bot logic to execute. This validation occurs immediately after checking for the adapter.

**Likely Fix:**
Create and provide a valid `AgentApplication` instance when calling `start_agent_process`. The application should be properly configured with handlers, storage, and any required middleware. Example: `agent_app = AgentApplication[TurnState](storage=storage, adapter=adapter, ...)`. Ensure your application initialization properly creates and stores the agent application instance before processing requests.

### -63002
Request Required

CloudAdapter.process: request can't be None

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when the `CloudAdapter.process` method is called without a valid HTTP request object. The request contains the incoming activity from the channel service, authentication headers, and other essential information needed to process the bot conversation. Without a request, the adapter cannot extract the activity or validate authentication.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure you're passing the HTTP request object from your web framework (aiohttp or FastAPI) to the adapter's process method. This is typically handled automatically by the `start_agent_process` function. If calling the adapter directly, verify you're passing the framework-specific request object. Check that your route handlers are correctly receiving and forwarding the request.

---

### -63003
Agent Required

CloudAdapter.process: agent can't be None

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when the `CloudAdapter.process` method is called without providing an agent (bot) instance. The agent contains the business logic and handlers that process incoming activities. Without an agent, the adapter has nothing to delegate message processing to, making the request impossible to handle.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure you're passing a valid agent instance (typically your `AgentApplication`) to the adapter's process method. This should be handled automatically when using `start_agent_process`. If calling the adapter directly, verify you're passing the correct agent instance. Check that your agent application is properly initialized and not None.

---

### -63004
Stream Already Ended

The stream has already ended.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when attempting to write to or interact with a streaming response that has already been closed or ended. Streaming responses are used for real-time bot interactions where responses are sent incrementally. Once a stream is ended, no further operations can be performed on it, and attempting to do so raises this error.

**Likely Fix:**
Review your streaming response logic to ensure you're not attempting to write to streams after they've been closed. Check for proper stream lifecycle management in your code. Ensure error handling doesn't attempt to write error messages to already-closed streams. Consider tracking stream state to prevent operations on ended streams.

---

### -63005
Turn Context Required

TurnContext cannot be None.

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when an operation requiring a turn context receives None. The turn context is fundamental to bot operations, representing the current conversational turn and providing access to the activity, conversation state, and response methods. Many core bot operations depend on having a valid turn context.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure you're always passing a valid TurnContext to operations that require it. Turn contexts are created by the adapter and passed to bot handlers. Check that your handler signatures are correct and accepting the turn context parameter. Verify you're not accidentally passing None due to variable naming issues or incorrect parameter passing.

---

### -63006
Activity Required

Activity cannot be None.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when an operation expects an activity object but receives None. Activities are the fundamental units of communication in the Bot Framework, representing messages, events, typing indicators, and other communication types. Operations that process or manipulate activities cannot function without a valid activity object.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure you're passing valid Activity objects to operations that require them. Activities are typically accessed via `context.activity`. Verify that activity creation or extraction is working correctly. Check for None values before passing activities to operations. For manually created activities, ensure they're properly initialized with required properties.

---

### -63007
App ID Required

AppId cannot be empty or None.

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when an operation requires the bot's application ID (client ID) but it's missing or empty. The app ID identifies your bot in the Microsoft ecosystem and is required for authentication, authorization, and routing. Many security and service communication operations depend on having a valid app ID.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure your bot's application ID is properly configured in your `AgentAuthConfiguration`. The app ID should be set as `CLIENT_ID` in your configuration. Verify you've registered your bot in Azure and obtained the application ID. Check that environment variables or configuration files containing the app ID are being loaded correctly.

---

### -63008
Invalid Activity Type

Invalid or missing activity type.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when an activity has an invalid, unsupported, or missing activity type. Activity types define what kind of communication is happening (e.g., message, conversationUpdate, event). Operations often need to handle different activity types differently, and an invalid type prevents proper processing.

**Likely Fix:**
Verify that activities are being created with valid activity types from the `ActivityTypes` enumeration (e.g., `ActivityTypes.message`, `ActivityTypes.conversation_update`). Check that incoming activities from channels have proper types set. If manually creating activities, ensure you're setting the `type` property correctly. Review activity type handling logic to ensure it accounts for all expected types.

---

### -63009
Conversation ID Required

Conversation ID cannot be empty or None.

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when an operation requires a conversation ID but it's missing or empty. The conversation ID uniquely identifies a conversation thread and is essential for maintaining conversation context, managing state, and routing messages correctly. Without it, the system cannot associate activities with the correct conversation.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure incoming activities have valid conversation IDs. Check that the conversation reference is properly set in activities. For proactive messages, verify you're providing a valid conversation reference with a conversation ID. Review state management to ensure conversation IDs are being correctly extracted and stored.

---

### -63010
Auth Header Required

Authorization header is required.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when an incoming request is missing the required authorization header. The authorization header contains the bearer token used to authenticate requests between the channel service and your bot. This authentication is crucial for security, preventing unauthorized access to your bot endpoint.

**Likely Fix:**
Verify that the channel service (Teams, Bot Framework, etc.) is properly configured to send authentication headers. Check that your bot endpoint URL is correctly registered in the Azure Bot Service. Ensure you're not accidentally stripping authorization headers in middleware or proxies. For local development, verify the Bot Framework Emulator is configured for authentication.

---

### -63011
Invalid Auth Header

Invalid authorization header format.

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when the authorization header is present but malformed or doesn't follow the expected format. The SDK expects authorization headers in a specific format (typically "Bearer <token>"). An invalid format prevents proper token extraction and validation.

**Likely Fix:**
Verify the authorization header format matches the expected pattern. Check for proper "Bearer " prefix. Ensure no extra whitespace or encoding issues. If implementing custom authentication middleware, verify it's not modifying the header format. Review channel service configuration to ensure it's sending properly formatted headers.

---

### -63012
Claims Identity Required

ClaimsIdentity is required.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when an operation requires a claims identity (representing the authenticated identity) but it's missing. Claims identities are created after successful authentication and contain information about who is making the request. Many authorization decisions depend on having a valid claims identity.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure your authentication middleware is properly processing authorization headers and creating claims identities. Verify the JWT authorization middleware is correctly configured and active. Check that authentication is succeeding before operations that require claims identities are called. Review the authentication flow to ensure claims identities are being properly attached to requests.

---

### -63013
Channel Service Route Not Found

Channel service route not found for: {route}

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when the SDK receives a request for a channel service route that doesn't exist or isn't registered. Channel service routes handle specific callbacks and events from the Bot Framework service, such as activity delivery, conversation updates, and other service-to-bot communications.

**Likely Fix:**
Verify that your route table is properly configured with all required channel service routes. Use the `channel_service_route_table` helper to automatically register standard routes. Check that the route path in the request matches registered routes. Ensure you haven't accidentally removed or misconfigured required routes during application setup.

---

### -63014
Token Exchange Required

Token exchange requires a token exchange resource.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when attempting a token exchange operation without providing the required token exchange resource. Token exchange is used for single sign-on scenarios where user tokens need to be exchanged for tokens to access downstream services. The resource parameter specifies what service the new token should grant access to.

**Likely Fix:**
Provide a valid token exchange resource when calling token exchange operations. The resource should be the application ID URI of the service you want to access. Verify your bot and resource are properly configured for token exchange in Azure AD. Check that OAuth connection settings include the correct exchange URL and resource configuration.

---

### -63015
Missing HTTP Client

HTTP client is required.

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when an operation requiring an HTTP client to make external service calls doesn't have one available. HTTP clients are used for communicating with Bot Framework services, authentication endpoints, and other external APIs. Without an HTTP client, these communications cannot occur.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure HTTP clients are properly initialized and passed to components that need them. Verify dependency injection or manual initialization of HTTP clients is working correctly. Check that the adapter or connection manager has a properly configured HTTP client. For custom implementations, ensure you're creating and providing HTTP clients where required.

---

### -63016
Invalid Bot Framework Activity

Invalid Bot Framework Activity format.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when an activity doesn't conform to the Bot Framework Activity schema or has invalid/missing required properties. The Bot Framework has specific requirements for activity structure, and violations of these requirements can cause processing failures or unexpected behavior.

**Likely Fix:**
Verify that activities are being created according to the Bot Framework Activity schema. Check that all required properties are set with valid values. For manually created activities, use the Activity class constructor properly. If deserializing activities from JSON, ensure the JSON structure is correct. Review any activity manipulation code to ensure it's not breaking the activity structure.

---

### -63017
Credentials Required

Credentials are required for authentication.

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when attempting authentication operations without providing valid credentials. Credentials may be a client secret, certificate, or other authentication mechanism depending on your configuration. Without credentials, the bot cannot authenticate itself to Azure services or the Bot Framework.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure your bot's credentials are properly configured in `AgentAuthConfiguration`. For client secret authentication, verify `CLIENT_SECRET` is set. For certificate authentication, ensure the certificate is properly loaded. Check that environment variables or configuration files containing credentials are being loaded correctly. Verify credentials haven't expired or been rotated without updating your configuration.

---

## Activity Errors (-64000 to -64999)

### -64000
Invalid Channel ID Type

Invalid type for channel_id: {type}. Expected ChannelId or str.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when setting a channel ID with an invalid type. Channel IDs can be either a `ChannelId` object or a string, but other types are not supported. This validation ensures type safety when working with channel identifiers in activities and helps catch programming errors early.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure you're passing either a string or a `ChannelId` object when setting channel IDs on activities. If using custom code to create or manipulate activities, verify the type of values being assigned to the `channel_id` property. Convert other types to strings before assignment if necessary.

---

### -64001
Channel ID Product Info Conflict

Conflict between channel_id.sub_channel and productInfo entity

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when there's a conflict between the sub-channel specified in the channel ID and product information entities. The sub-channel and product info represent related but distinct concepts, and having conflicting values can lead to routing or processing issues. This validation ensures consistency in channel identification.

**Likely Fix:**
Review your channel ID and product info entity configuration to ensure they're consistent. If setting a sub-channel, ensure it doesn't conflict with product information. Consider whether you need both sub-channel and product info entities, or if one is sufficient. Verify you're not accidentally setting conflicting values due to separate code paths.

---

### -64002
Channel ID Value Conflict

If value is provided, channel and sub_channel must be None

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when trying to set a raw channel ID value while also setting structured channel and sub-channel properties. The `ChannelId` class supports either a simple string value or structured components (channel + sub-channel), but not both simultaneously. This mutual exclusivity prevents ambiguous channel identification.

**Likely Fix:**
Choose either a simple string value for the channel ID or use the structured channel/sub-channel approach, but not both. If you need a simple channel identifier, set only the `value` property. If you need structured identification with sub-channels, use the `channel` and `sub_channel` properties instead. Clear one set of properties before setting the other.

---

### -64003
Channel ID Value Must Be Non-Empty

value must be a non empty string if provided

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when attempting to set an empty string as the channel ID value. An empty channel ID would make it impossible to identify which channel the activity belongs to, causing routing and processing failures. The SDK enforces non-empty values to maintain data integrity.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure channel ID values are never empty strings. Validate channel IDs before setting them on activities. If channel IDs come from external sources, add validation to reject empty values. Consider using None instead of empty strings when no channel ID is available, allowing proper null checking.

---

### -64004
Invalid From Property Type

Invalid type for from_property: {type}. Expected ChannelAccount or dict.

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when setting the `from` property (sender) on an activity with an invalid type. The `from` property represents who sent the activity and must be either a `ChannelAccount` object or a dictionary that can be converted to one. This type checking ensures proper representation of sender information.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure you're using either a `ChannelAccount` object or a properly structured dictionary when setting the `from` property. Dictionaries should include required properties like `id` and optionally `name`. If creating activities manually, use the `ChannelAccount` class constructor. Verify any serialization/deserialization is producing valid types.

---

### -64005
Invalid Recipient Type

Invalid type for recipient: {type}. Expected ChannelAccount or dict.

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when setting the `recipient` property (who receives the activity) with an invalid type. Similar to the `from` property, recipients must be represented as `ChannelAccount` objects or compatible dictionaries. This validation ensures the bot framework can properly route activities to the intended recipient.

**Likely Fix:**
Use either a `ChannelAccount` object or a properly structured dictionary when setting the `recipient` property. Ensure dictionaries include at minimum an `id` field. When creating response activities, use `TurnContext.activity.from_property` as the recipient (message back to sender). Verify type compatibility in any activity creation or manipulation code.

---

## Copilot Studio Errors (-65000 to -65999)

### -65000
Cloud Base Address Required

cloud_base_address must be provided when PowerPlatformCloud is Other

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when configuring a Copilot Studio connection with a custom Power Platform cloud environment (PowerPlatformCloud.Other) without providing the base address. When using custom or non-standard cloud environments, the SDK needs an explicit base URL to know where to connect. Standard clouds have known addresses, but custom clouds require explicit configuration.

**Likely Fix:**
Provide the `cloud_base_address` parameter when setting `PowerPlatformCloud` to `Other`. The base address should be the full URL to your custom Power Platform environment. Example: `cloud_base_address="https://your-custom-environment.powerplatform.com"`. Verify the URL is correct and accessible from your deployment environment.

---

### -65001
Environment ID Required

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when attempting to connect to Copilot Studio without providing a Power Platform environment ID. The environment ID identifies which Power Platform environment contains your Copilot Studio agent. Without it, the SDK cannot locate your agent or establish a connection.

**Likely Fix:**
Provide a valid Power Platform environment ID in your Copilot Studio configuration. You can find the environment ID in the Power Platform admin center or Copilot Studio settings. Set it in your connection settings: `EnvironmentId="your-environment-id"`. Verify you have access to the specified environment.

---

### -65002
Agent Identifier Required

AgentIdentifier must be provided

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when attempting to connect to a Copilot Studio agent without providing the agent identifier. The agent identifier uniquely identifies your Copilot Studio bot within the Power Platform environment. Without it, the SDK cannot determine which agent to connect to.

**Likely Fix:**
Provide the agent identifier (bot ID) from your Copilot Studio agent configuration. You can find this in the Copilot Studio portal under your agent's settings. Set it in your connection settings: `AgentIdentifier="your-agent-id"`. Ensure you're using the correct identifier for the environment you're connecting to.

---

### -65003
Custom Cloud or Base Address Required

Either CustomPowerPlatformCloud or cloud_base_address must be provided when PowerPlatformCloud is Other

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when using a custom Power Platform cloud (PowerPlatformCloud.Other) without providing either a custom cloud configuration or a base address. Custom cloud environments require explicit configuration about how to connect, either through a `CustomPowerPlatformCloud` object or a direct base address URL.

**Likely Fix:**
Provide either a `CustomPowerPlatformCloud` object with complete cloud configuration or a `cloud_base_address` string when using `PowerPlatformCloud.Other`. The custom cloud object should include all necessary endpoint URLs. For simpler scenarios, providing just the base address may be sufficient. Verify your custom cloud configuration is complete and correct.

---

### -65004
Invalid Connection Settings Type

connection_settings must be of type DirectToEngineConnectionSettings

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when providing connection settings of an incorrect type to a Copilot Studio operation. The SDK expects specific connection setting types for different operations, and `DirectToEngineConnectionSettings` is required for direct engine connections. Using the wrong type prevents proper connection establishment.

**Likely Fix:**
Ensure you're using `DirectToEngineConnectionSettings` when configuring direct connections to Copilot Studio. Create the settings object correctly: `settings = DirectToEngineConnectionSettings(...)`. Verify you're not accidentally passing a different settings type. Check that your connection configuration matches the intended connection pattern.

---

### -65005
Power Platform Environment Required

PowerPlatformEnvironment must be provided

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when a Power Platform environment specification is required but not provided. The Power Platform environment determines which cloud and region your Copilot Studio agent runs in. This information is essential for proper routing and connection.

**Likely Fix:**
Provide a valid `PowerPlatformEnvironment` in your configuration. Choose from standard environments like `PowerPlatformCloud.Public`, `PowerPlatformCloud.USGov`, etc., or specify `PowerPlatformCloud.Other` with custom configuration. Verify the environment matches where your Copilot Studio agent is deployed.

---

### -65006
Access Token Provider Required

AccessTokenProvider must be provided

**Description & Context:**
This error occurs when attempting to establish a Copilot Studio connection without providing an access token provider. The token provider is responsible for obtaining and refreshing authentication tokens needed to communicate with Copilot Studio services. Without it, authentication cannot occur.

**Likely Fix:**
Provide a valid `AccessTokenProvider` implementation in your Copilot Studio configuration. Typically, this would be an instance of `MsalAuth` or another authentication provider. Ensure the provider is properly configured with credentials and authority. Example: `access_token_provider=MsalAuth(auth_config)`.

---

## General/Validation Errors (-66000 to -66999)

Consider alternative approaches to accomplish your goal. If the operation should be supported, verify your configuration and state are correct. Check if the operation requires specific setup or prerequisites that aren't met.

---

### -66004
Resource Not Found

Resource not found: {resource}

**Description & Context:**
This error is raised when attempting to access a resource (file, database record, external service, etc.) that doesn't exist or cannot be found. This could be due to incorrect identifiers, resources not being created yet, or access/permission issues preventing discovery.

**Likely Fix:**
Verify the resource identifier is correct. Check that the resource has been created and exists in the expected location. Ensure your bot/agent has necessary permissions to access the resource. For files, verify paths are correct and files are deployed. For database resources, verify they're created and migrations are applied. Check for typos in resource names or identifiers.

---

### -66005
Unexpected Error

An unexpected error occurred: {details}

**Description & Context:**
This is a catch-all error for unexpected conditions that don't fit more specific error categories. It indicates something went wrong that wasn't anticipated by normal error handling. The error details provide information about what went wrong to aid in diagnosis.

**Likely Fix:**

# C# Error Codes

## Authentication Errors (-40000 to -40100)

### -40000
Missing Authentication Configuration

No connections found in for this Agent in the Connections Configuration

**Description & Context:**  
This error is thrown when the AgentSDK's authentication component attempts to retrieve a default authentication connection and discovers none are defined in the agent configuration. This typically means either the `Connections` section is missing, empty, or misconfigured in your appsettings or other configuration source. The absence is logged as an error and then the exception is raised to prevent further operations that require authentication.

**Likely Fix:**  
Review your appsettings (or equivalent configuration). Ensure at least one valid authentication connection is present under the `Connections` key. See the [configuration reference](https://aka.ms/M365AgentsErrorCodes/#-40000) for schema and examples. A minimal fix is to define the `Connections` section with at least one valid connection entry.

---

### -40001
Connection Not Found By Name

Connection '{0}' not found in configuration

**Description & Context:**  
This error is thrown by `ConfigurationConnections.GetConnection(string name)` when a requested connection name does not exist in the configuration dictionary. The system supports retrieving multiple named connections; a non-existent name indicates a typo or missing configuration.

**Likely Fix:**  
Check your caller's request for typos in the connection name. Confirm that your application's configuration file (e.g., appsettings.json) includes the specifically named connection under the `Connections` section.

---

### -40002
Failed To Create Auth Module Provider

Failed to create authentication provider for connection name '{0}'

**Description & Context:**  
This occurs during the instantiation of an IAccessTokenProvider for a configured connection. If reflection fails to construct the provider—perhaps due to constructor signature mismatch or missing dependencies—this error is thrown.

**Likely Fix:**  
Check the configuration for correct assembly and type names for custom authentication providers. Ensure the type can be instantiated using the expected constructor, and all required dependencies/services are available.

---

### -40003
Auth Provider Type Not Found

Type '{0}' not found in Assembly '{1}' or is the wrong type for '{2}'

**Description & Context:**  
The system uses reflection to locate and instantiate IAccessTokenProvider implementations. If the configured provider type can't be found, or isn't assignable to the expected interface, this error is thrown.

**Likely Fix:**  
Check your configuration for typos in the type or assembly names. Make sure your custom provider is correctly implemented and public, and that it matches the expected interface (`IAccessTokenProvider`).

---

### -40004
Auth Provider Type Invalid Constructor

Type '{0},{1}' does not have the required constructor.

**Description & Context:**  
This error arises when the specified authentication provider type exists but does not have a public constructor matching the required signature (typically `(IServiceProvider, IConfigurationSection)`). The system tries to create the provider via reflection, and throws when the required constructor is not present.

**Likely Fix:**  
Ensure the custom authentication provider exposes a public constructor with appropriate parameters. Check for any typos or parameter mismatch. Update the provider class as needed and redeploy.

---

### -40005
Configuration Section Not Found

Authentication configuration section '{0}' not Found.

**Description & Context:**  
This is thrown when a configuration constructor receives a section name but that section can't be found in the overall configuration. This frequently happens if the configuration (e.g., appsettings.json) is missing an expected section.

**Likely Fix:**  
Add or correct the named configuration section in your appsettings or configuration provider source. Double-check for casing or naming mismatches.

---

### -40006
Configuration Section Not Provided

No configuration section provided. An authentication configuration section is required to create a connection settings object.

**Description & Context:**  
This error occurs when an operation that requires a configuration section to initialize (such as creating connection settings) is called without one being provided. The constructor for the authentication settings expects a section, and throws if it receives null.

**Likely Fix:**  
Ensure that the calling code supplies a valid IConfigurationSection when constructing this settings object. Review how configuration is loaded and passed into the component, and consider adding null-checks upstream.
